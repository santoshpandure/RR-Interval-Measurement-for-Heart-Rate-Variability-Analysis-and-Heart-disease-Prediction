# RR-Interval-Measurement-for-Heart-Rate-Variability-Analysis-and-Heart-disease-Prediction
Heart is the most important organ in the human body and the efforts were taken in order to understand the heart beats in precise manner. There were several mechanism were observed
and one of the most popular mechanism form representation of electrical activities tracing on paper is electrocardiogram (ECG). The Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is also well known
functionality devised for understanding functionality of heart its measure was derived manually, more prominently from the ECG. The electrical conduction through the heart follows
a set pathway under normal conditions. Disturbances in these pathways may leads in altering the pathway, the wave of depolarization must follow and change in timing of the electrical events were observed. Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval, has become a popular clinical and investigational tools. Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the time interval between heartbeats. It is measured by the variation in the beat-to-beat interval.
